# LightNet v3 → v4 Migration Guides

This document has been split into two guides, depending on your audience:

- `docs/migrate-v4-humans.md` — narrative guide for developers.
- `docs/migrate-v4-ai.md` — structured guide for AI agents (skill-compatible).

**Important:** These guides are for consumer projects that depend on the `lightnet` npm package. Do not edit files inside `node_modules/lightnet`.
