# LightNet

Share the message of Jesus and strengthen believers worldwide. LightNet empowers you to create digital media libraries, making your Christian content accessible on the web â€” including videos, audio, images, and books.

LightNet is built as an integration for the Astro framework, enabling the creation of statically generated sites that can be hosted on any file server. These sites are fast, easily extendable, and fully support internationalization. Explore more in our [developer documentation](https://lightnet-docs.pages.dev).

Check out our [example page](https://sk8-ministries.pages.dev) showcasing LightNet in action for a fictional skateboard ministry.
