# LightNet

Share the message of Jesus and strengthen believers worldwide.

LightNet empowers ministries to run their own digital media libraries. They can easily share content in the heart language of the communities they serve - including videos, audio, images, and documents.

It is built as an integration for the [Astro framework](https://astro.build), enabling the creation of statically generated sites that can be hosted on any file server. These sites are fast, easily extendable, and fully support internationalization.

## Documentation
